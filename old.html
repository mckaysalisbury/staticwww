        Twice as long ago:
        <script>
            targetDate = new Date(document.location.hash.slice(1));
            nowDate = new Date();
            difference = nowDate - targetDate;
            double = new Date(targetDate - difference);
            half = new Date(targetDate - 0 + difference / 2); // is `.getTime()` faster than `- 0`? Don't care. `.getTime()` feels like it ought to be more intuitive, but when I see it, I think "Oh, is this just getting the time portion?" or something else wrong. `- 0` feels like it is less intuitive, but yet, you also know you're getting a number out. So I like it better.

            document.write(double);
            document.write("<br/>Half as long ago: ");
            document.write(half);
