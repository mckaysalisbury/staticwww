I host this with github pages, so it's free hosting for me. The repo is for me, it's not for you. I mean, legally, it's on Github, so you're allowed to fork it, and IMO, that means you're allowed to take a look. Feel free to do so, I don't particularly care, but there's nothing exciting. As of this writing, I was using [McBlocks](https://github.com/mckaysalisbury/McBlocks) for the homepage. At one point, I was particularly proud of [the source for the page](view-source:https://www.mckaysalisbury.com/). Now? Meh, it's fine.
